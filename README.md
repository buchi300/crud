# crud
 Creating a CRUD application
 Just playing around with crud functionalities
 
 the sql required is crud.sql
 install and make sure you add a username and password to the user table
 
 Copywrite
 I own all the php codes but I used templates from https://bootstrapmade.com/ to enhance the frontend 
 If you wish to make use of the CSS, and Javasript for the front end you need to add footer creditfrom https://bootstrapmade.com/ or pay to have it removed.
 I currently have a life long payment which enables me to use their templates without credit
